This repository consist of 4 files.

4. Assignment5.docx

To simulate a run. Run the main.py file. 

To change the size of the generated arrays for the sort simulation change the "size" variable value on line 63 to your liking.

Overall this comparison really shows how effective randomized pivot quick sort is in solving the worst case scenario for deterministic quick sort.
